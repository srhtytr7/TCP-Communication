# TCP-Communication
Tcp communication examples in C#

1. In the first example, there is a server and a client. Server and client have listboxes and send buttons. I created random numbers and filled listboxes with this numbers. Then i used buttons to transmit this random numbers with tcp protocol in which way i wanted.

2. In the second example, i used this https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplesockettester&hl=tr android app to send and receive data from my phone to my laptop. Sometimes you may need to restart the program so be aware of that.  Second app has 2 forms in it. You can try it as a server or as a client. Both of them work fine.They both send and receive data continuously with threading.
